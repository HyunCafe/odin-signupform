# odin-signupform
All Odin Projects are made from scratch.
The Odin Signup Form project was built as part of my learning journey.

This project showcases my proficiency in several programming languages and technologies, including HTML, which I used to create semantic login forms and ensure proper document structure. I also demonstrated my skill in CSS by utilizing it to style and design the layout and aesthetic appearance of the project. As someone who enjoys the process of styling and design, I spent a significant amount of time perfecting the look and feel of the project. Overall, this project is a testament to my knowledge and abilities in web development, and my commitment to continually improving and refining my skills.

In addition, it demonstrates my ability to:

* Use third-party libraries such as Font Awesome and Meyer Reset to enhance the design
* Validate HTML and CSS to ensure high-quality code
* Debug and solve complex programming challenges
* Manage project timelines and plan future implementations
* Continually iterate and improve upon designs to achieve desired outcomes
* Make responsive designs with breakpoints

* Feat: Made it responsive with breakpoints
## TO DO:
- Add Indicators when filling out fields (color coded)
- Have it work as a fully working Signup and have a login form with Popular Fast fills
like Gmail, Facebook, Twitter

## Challenges:
##### HTML Validation Challenge
* Faced an issue with invalid HTML, which resulted in errors and warnings when running the HTML through a validator
* Attempted to solve the issue by manually correcting the errors and warnings one by one, but this proved to be time-consuming and inefficient
* Found a VS Code extension, Prettier, that helped to auto-format the HTML and correct some of the errors and warnings
* Created a .prettierrc file in the root directory to customize the Prettier settings and ensure consistent formatting across the project
* This approach helped to improve the quality of the HTML and reduce the number of errors and warnings when running it through a validator

##### CSS Styling Challenge
* Faced an issue with styling the login form and wallpaper section to achieve the desired look and feel
* Experimented with different styles and techniques, such as adding a frosted effect to the background, using floating circles for aesthetic purposes, and adding font to enhance the overall appearance
* Ran the CSS through a validator and made corrections to improve the quality and ensure the CSS was well-formed
* Enjoyed the process of styling but spent a lot of time on it compared to the rest of the code in writing
* By continually experimenting and refining the styling, the desired look and feel was achieved, resulting in an aesthetically pleasing design
